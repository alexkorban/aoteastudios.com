# Business Analysis Template Kit

<style>

</style>

It's hard to produce complete documentation without document templates. There are just too many things to remember! But quality BA templates are hard to find, and they take a lot of time to create.

_Do you want to save time by starting from a solid foundation? Would you like to make sure you don't miss any documentation steps?_

We spent our time producing this kit so you don't have to! It has everything you need to document BA work during a project, and by using this kit you will make sure that nothing gets overlooked.

## What you get:

The kit contains <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">13 templates</span>:

<ul class = "check">
<li>Business Analysis Plan</li>
<li>Current State Analysis</li>
<li>Project Vision</li>
<li>Requirements Management Plan</li>
<li>Solution Vision</li>
<li>Business Requirements</li>
<li>Use Case Model</li>
<li>Use Case Specification</li>
<li>Business Process Design</li>
<li>Non-Functional Requirements</li>
<li>Interface Specification</li>
<li>Business Case</li>
<li>Solution Glossary</li>
</ul>

We've included a detailed <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">requirements management plan</span> in the template set. The kit also contains a <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">20-page guide</span> on BA documentation which explains how the templates relate to the _BABoK_® and includes a chart of the relationships between BA documents.

Even if you have specific documentation requirements which aren't covered by these templates, this kit will serve as a great starting point.
