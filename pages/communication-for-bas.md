# It's hard to get stakeholders to do their part.

Some people don't see your value or see you as a distraction from their jobs. Others think your job is only to write their ideas down. Your PM makes unreasonable demands all the time. Executives don't seem to follow your presentations very well.

However, you need to find ways of working with all these people towards successful project completion. And do it while juggling projects and meeting deadlines of course. 

## What if you had better ways of dealing with stakeholders?

Imagine having effective techniques to engage people so that they actively contribute and work with you. Imagine being able to get the PM and executives on your side with ease. 

Imagine that business users were actually asking to work with _you_ and not other BAs because they see the value you bring. 

## Become a better communicator with the _Visual Communication for BAs_ course.
